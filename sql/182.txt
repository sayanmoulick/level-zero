182. Duplicate Emails
SQL Schema
Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.

SELECT email FROM Person GROUP BY email HAVING COUNT(email) > 1;

Use self join.

 SELECT DISTINCT a.Email
 FROM Person a JOIN Person b
 ON (a.Email = b.Email)
 WHERE a.Id <> b.Id
Use subquery with EXISTS:

 SELECT DISTINCT a.Email
 FROM Person a
 WHERE EXISTS(
     SELECT 1
     FROM Person b
     WHERE a.Email = b.Email
     LIMIT 1, 1
 )
Basic idea is this query:

 SELECT DISTINCT Email FROM Person
 MINUS
 (SELECT Id, Email FROM Person GROUP BY Email)
But since MySQL does not support MINUS, we use LEFT JOIN:

 SELECT DISTINCT a.Email FROM Person a
 LEFT JOIN (SELECT Id, Email from Person GROUP BY Email) b
 ON (a.email = b.email) AND (a.Id = b.Id)
 WHERE b.Email IS NULL
